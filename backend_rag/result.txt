Query: What is the foward voltage of the LED
-------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------
Here follows the context containing the 5 nearest-neighbours:
-------------------------------------------------------------
‚Ä¢ Forward Current ( ùêºùëì): 20mA - 30mA   
The forward current is the current flowing through the LED when it is conducting. For 
optimal brightness and efficiency, this LED operates at a forward current between 
20mA and 30mA.  
 
‚Ä¢ Maximum Reverse Voltage ( ùëâùëü): 5V   
The maximum reverse voltage is the highest voltage that can be applied in the 
reverse direction without damaging the LED. For this LED, the maximum reverse 
voltage is 5V.  
 
‚Ä¢ Power Dissipation ( ùëÉùëë): 0.1W - 0.2W

---

‚Ä¢ Product Name:  High-Efficiency LED Light   
‚Ä¢ Model Number:  HLED -1234   
‚Ä¢ Manufacturer:  BrightLights Inc.   
 
Electrical Characteristics : 
‚Ä¢ Forward Voltage ( ùëâùëì): 2.8V - 3.3V   
The forward voltage is the voltage drop across the LED when it is in the forward 
direction (i.e., conducting). This LED operates within the range of 2.8V to 3.3V.  
 
‚Ä¢ Forward Current ( ùêºùëì): 20mA - 30mA   
The forward current is the current flowing through the LED when it is conducting. For

reverse direction without damaging the LED. For this LED, the maximum reverse 
voltage is 5V.  
 
‚Ä¢ Power Dissipation ( ùëÉùëë): 0.1W - 0.2W   
Power dissipation is the amount of power in the form of heat that the LED can safely 
dissipate. This LED has a power dissipation range from 0.1W to 0.2W.  
 
‚Ä¢ Luminous Intensity ( ùêºùë£): 3000mcd - 5000mcd   
Luminous intensity is the measure of the visible light emitted by the LED. This LED 
has a luminous intensity range from 3000 millicandela (mcd) to 5000mcd.

The table below helps you select the basic settings for the types of food 
you want to prepare.
Note
 ‚Ä¢Keep in mind that these settings are suggestions. As ingredients differ in origin, 
size, shape as well as brand, we cannot guarantee the best setting for your 
ingredients.
 ‚Ä¢When preparing larger amount of food (e.g. fries, prawns, drumsticks, frozen 
snacks), shake, turn, or stir the ingredients in the basket 2 to 3 times in order to

Software updates
Updating is essential to safeguard your privacy and the proper functioning 
of your Airfryer and the App.
From time to time, the App is updating automatically to the latest software. 
Also the Airfryer is updating the firmware automatically.
Note
 ‚Ä¢When an update is being installed, make sure that your Airfryer is connected to

Tip
 ‚Ä¢If food residues stuck to the pan or the basket, you can soak them in hot water 
and dishwashing liquid for 10‚Äì15 minutes. Soaking loosens the food residues 
and makes it easier to remove. Make sure you use a dishwashing liquid that 
can dissolve oil and grease. If there are grease stains on the pan or the basket 
and you have not been able to remove them with hot water and dishwashing 
liquid, use a liquid degreaser.

Note
 ‚Ä¢The Airfryer can prepare a large range of ingredients. Consult the ‚ÄòFood table‚Äô 
for the right quantities and approximate cooking times.
 ‚Ä¢Do not exceed the amount indicated in the ‚ÄòFood table‚Äô section or overfill the 
basket beyond the ‚ÄòMAX‚Äô indication as this could affect the quality of the end 
result.
